# MessageBox
## Breaking Facebook's Chat Heads out of the iOS Sandbox

### Intro
MessageBox is a jailbreak extension for iOS that allows users to use Facebook Messenger's Chat Heads system-wide in iOS. Currently this only works in conjunction with [Paper](https://facebook.com/paper/) and iOS 7.

[The Verge](http://www.theverge.com/2013/4/17/4235816/chat-heads-for-iphone-jailbreak-tweak) approves! :P

For more technical info I did a [blog post](http://blog.adambell.ca/post/73338421921/breaking-chat-heads-out-of-the-ios-sandbox) as well!

The [original hack](https://github.com/b3ll/MessageBox-olde) has been deprecated and will no longer be supported, however back-porting a lot of this to iOS 6 shouldn't be too difficult (for those of you still on iOS 6).

### How do I MessageBox?
Open Paper, wait for everything to appear, press the Home button. Magic! :D

**If you open the app and close it super quickly, you're going to have a bad time!**

### Price?
Totally free! If you'd like to support my continuation of this project (and others!), feel free to [donate](http://www.adambell.ca/donate)! It'd be much appreciated :D

### How do I get?
It's on Cydia under the BigBoss repo!

### How do I compile?
[@DHowett](https://www.twitter.com/DHowett) was very sad when he realized I didn't use [theos](https://www.github.com/DHowett/theos) for my initial version of MessageBox, and seeing as how it's now the suggested route for [Cydia Substrate](http://cydiasubstrate.com/) so I've switched to that (though, I'm using [@rpetrich's fork](https://www.github.com/rpetrich/theos) since it's nicer for working with universal builds).

Once you've got that setup, (nice writeup [here](http://iphonedevwiki.net/index.php/Theos/Getting_Started)) change the Makefile to your liking. After that simply run:

    THEOS_DEVICE_IP=<your ip here> THEOS_DEVICE_PORT=<your SSH port here> make package install

### License?
Pretty much the BSD license, just don't repackage it and call it your own please!

Also if you do make some changes, feel free to make a pull request and help make things more awesome!
